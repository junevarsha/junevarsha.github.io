  <div class="a">I am Varsha Thirumakil, a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.vistaprint.com/">Vistaprint</a>.
<br /> <br />
Five years ago, I moved to the United States from India to pursue my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of New Hampshire. After graduating from UNH I joined as a Software Engineer at Blackhawk Network(CashStar) where I worked on developing, designing eCommerce web applications with a focus on Django/Python on the backend and Javascript/React+Redux technologies on the frontend.Outside of work, I enjoy organizing tech community events, beach walks and exploring local coffee shops in Portland-Maine and Boston. I would like to call myself as a Thrill Seeker & Spicy-food Connoisseur.

<!-- I have enjoyed a trip aboard the Codzilla-speedboat in Boston, visiting Six Flags in Springfield, Universal Studios in Singapore and Skydiving in Maine. They have all been memorable experiences --></div>
